<p style="text-align:center"> Keep these rules in mind to maximize your chance of killing germs and reduce the spread of contagion! Remember: avoid touching your face, keep at least 6 feet of distance between you and other people when outside, and follow safety precautions at all times! As a child of a healthcare worker, your parent is on the frontlines and could possibly bring contagion with them. If they ask you to stay with another relative, understand that they only want you to stay healthy! If you want to learn more facts about COVID-19, grab and trusted adult and click on the image below to be redirected to the official Center for Disease Control's (CDC) website.

      <h3 style="text-align:center">The Future</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center">At the moment, the future is unknown. By staying clean and reducing close contact with other people, it can be ensured that COVID-19 won't spread further. Watch the video below with a trusted adult to understand what the future might entail. </p>
        <iframe width="350" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qi0edf_nJDo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
          </p>
         <p style="text-align:center">The healthcare worker in your family has a big task at hand. They are the ones taking care of patients and are very close to contagion. Try to help around the house, go on family walks outside, and establish a routine. As for school, chances of going back in the fall are getting lower as cases in the US are not yet stabilized and decreasing. Around the world, countries are opening up their schools only after a  significant decrease in cases. However, the US has yet to see a large drop in cases. In the case of virtual schooling, make sure you are prepared to learn just as much as you would in person. Remember:
           <ul>
              <li>Pay attention to the teacher</li>
              <li>Do your homework</li>
              <li>Ask questions if you don't understand anything</li>
          </ul> 
         </p>
         <p style="text-align:center"> With everything that's going on, it's okay to be stressed. Just remember to keep focused on what matters most to you. Support your parents if they are stressed with work. Talk to them if you are nervous about the future. Be as safe and clean as possible to maximize your efforts against COVID-19~
